csciutto's vimfiles

These are my custom vim files with my basic settings and plugins
Stored on Git for easy initialization on new machines

Pre-installed `vundle` plugins
- Ctrl P
- Nerdtree
- delimitMate
- Fireplace REPL
- Surround
- EasyAlign
- and others...

To work, move the content of this file to a `.vim` file in root.

Then add `source .vim/vimrc` to the root `.vimrc`.

Finally, run `vim +PluginInstall +qall`
